Vampire Weekend’s newest, _Contra_, is fairly unimpressive. What we get is a slightly more refined and better produced version of their debut. The quasi-afro-beat influence, along with regurgitated new-wave, create nice background music for a college party. Thankfully the great production values and decent instrumentation save an otherwise unfortunate serious listening experience. Nothing is terribly wrong, but the album just isn’t that interesting on detailed listen.
