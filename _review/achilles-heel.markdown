I find the song writing of **David Bazaan** to be more engaging and enjoyable in my everyday life than most. I like his straight forward, very honest style. Perhaps it is that he writes mostly about everyday sorts of things, being married, believing in his friends, how suddenly after a terrorist attack a nation believes in god, that sort of thing. 

_Achilles Heel_ is his latest **Pedro the Lion** record (the headphones record is newer, and basically the same song writing, its just done with keyboards and synths instead of guitars. **T.W. Walsh** even was his collaborator on it, just like the PTL records).

_Achilles Heel_ to me is the best technical record that Bazaan has yet to release. It just sounds great. The guitars are crunchy but clear, drums sit nicely in the mix, Vocals are spot on and ride effortlessly along with the tunes. The content is nothing new or ground breaking, but it is what I have come to expect from the man. Highlights from the album for me were _Foregone Conclusions_, _Arizona_ - a little love triste between states... _Transcontinental_, and _A Simple Plan_.

For those looking for more **Pedro the Lion** to listen to, I highly recommend _The Only Reason I Feel Secure_, an older release (actually available now as a re-releaseâ€”that first got me hooked on **Bazaan**'s song writing). I don't love everything that he does, but what I do like I cannot get enough of, and that is what makes him such a great songwriter to me.
